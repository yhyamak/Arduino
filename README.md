# Arduino
# This is a sketch for measur Bullet Speed with ESP32 :
you have to connect pin 4 and pin 23 to 5v source with thin wire then put wire (4) and wire (23) in front of the gun and shoot the wires (cut them with the bullet),
then ESP32 will make wireless AP with name the speed of bullet.



* Dont Forget to put pullup resistor  to pin(4) and pin(23)
